haveged (1.7-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:                              (Closes: #689673)
    - Since haveged 1.5, entropy is tested at runtime. (Closes: #651980)
  * Refresh Debian patches.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Add missing license paragraph in debian/copyright.
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 9 for hardening and multi-arch.
  * Switch to multiple binary packages as upstream has extracted most
    features to a library. We now ship libhavege1, libhavege1-dbg and
    libhavege-dev on top of haveged itself.
  * Add upstream answers to concerns regarding HAVEGE in virtualized
    environments in README.Debian.

haveged (1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable NIST test suite on mips and mipsel as it takes way
    too long on these architectures. At least long enough to prevent the
    package build to complete properly.

 -- Jérémy Bobbio <lunar@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Apr 2012 15:58:39 +0200

haveged (1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add patch by Sven Hartge to overcome mips build failures:
    let's make the CUSUM and RANDOM EXCURSION tests be a little more
    verbose about their progress. That should help us stay under the 5
    allowed minutes of inactivity.

    increase the average depth of the entropy pool.

    for solving this.
