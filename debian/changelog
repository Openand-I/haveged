haveged (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed '--' from init script start_daemon line. It was preventing
    haveged from using the options passed from the default file.
  * Set '-w 1024' in the defaults file to raise the low water mark and
    increase the average depth of the entropy pool.
  * Added build-dep for gcc-4.3 (Closes: #563938). Thanks to Sven Hartge
    for solving this.
  * Replaced dh_clean -k with dh_prep (lintian warning)
  * Updated standards to 3.8.3
