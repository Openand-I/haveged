v1.7  (Jan 15, 2013)

   The build has been restructured to provide a devel package. This introduces a new libtool
   dependency. The new contrib/build/build.sh script is intended to toggle this requirement
   as well as providing a bootstrap to recover from automake mismatches. The script will also
   build and run devel sample code for those interested in using the devel package.
   
   Other build related changes include updating AC_PREQ to a more resonable, 2.59 and changing
   the build option for init scripts to default to --enable-init=none. The format of the
   haveged diagnostic display has changed to provided more information and the output is now
   displayed after output is generated in the non-daemon case.
